##Addition for staff members:
Being purple does not exempt you from these rules. Repeated/large offences and abuse of mod powers WILL lead to demotion.  
Encouraging others to break any rule will be punished by a higher authority staff member.  
Remember, you are supposed to set a good example for the rest of the community.
